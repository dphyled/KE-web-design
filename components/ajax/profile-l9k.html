    <p>A brief history... Kelly and Eriya met at Kailua Junior High School, in the small town of Kailua on the east side of Oahu, Hawaii. Later in university, Kelly decided to study Computer Science, while Eriya majored in Graphic Design. Each went on to work independently in his own field, while remaining great friends. One night over drinks, a few years after the two had moved to Tokyo, they finally discussed combining their individual talents to form a web company, and so L9K was born!  After all, what's better than working with your best friend?</p>
