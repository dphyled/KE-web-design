    <p>L9K is a web design company based in Tokyo, Japan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eriya takes care of most of the design, including layout, color scheme, typography, and graphics, while Kelly handles the coding and development.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although L9K is still a young company just starting out in the industry, both members are exteremly motivated and ambitious, each bringing a variety of skills to the team.</p>
    <p>A brief history...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelly and Eriya met at Kailua Junior High School, in the small town of Kailua on the east side of Oahu, Hawaii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later in university, Kelly decided to study Computer Science, while Eriya majored in Graphic Design.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each went on to work independently in his own field, while remaining great friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One night over drinks, a few years after the two had moved to Tokyo, they finally discussed combining their individual talents to form a web company, and so L9K was born!  After all, what's better than working with your best friend?</p>
